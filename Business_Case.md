## 1. Executive Summary

The real estate business required a unified analytical solution to monitor financial performance, sales trends, and regional market contribution.
To address this need, an interactive **Power BI dashboard** was developed to transform fragmented operational data into actionable insights for leadership, sales teams, and finance stakeholders.

The solution enabled real-time visibility into revenue, expenses, profitability, and agent performance, supporting data-driven decision-making and operational optimization.

This resulted in delayed decisions, inefficient allocation of resources, and limited strategic visibility.
